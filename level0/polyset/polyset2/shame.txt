Here's how wikipedia defines sets and bags:

In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without 
any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. 
Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one 
typically tests a value for membership in a set.

A generalization of the notion of a set is that of a multiset or bag, which is similar to 
a set but allows repeated ("equal") values (duplicates). This is used in two distinct senses: 
either equal values are considered identical, and are simply counted, or equal values are 
considered equivalent, and are stored as distinct items.
